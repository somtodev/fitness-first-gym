## Introduction

The Fitness First GYM project aims to develop a comprehensive website for a local gym facility to improve membership management, online booking, and member communication. The project targets three main user groups: Guest Users, Registered Users, and Admin Users. Guest Users can browse information and make inquiries, while Registered Users can register, book packages, and manage their profiles. Admin Users have full control over system management.
